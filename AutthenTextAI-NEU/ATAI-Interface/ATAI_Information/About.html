                Using AuthenText AI is simple yet powerful. Upon submission, <br/>
                our algorithm meticulously analyzes the text, comparing it <br/>
                against a vast database of known AI-generated content and <br/>
                human-authored works. Through a combination of linguistic <br/>
                analysis, pattern recognition, and machine learning, AuthenText <br/>
                AI accurately identifies any instances of AI-generated text, <br/>
                preserving the integrity of academic assessments.

                Our AI detection model includes several components that analyze text <br/>
                to determine its origin and if it was written by AI. We use a multi-stage <br/>
                methodology designed to optimize accuracy while minimizing false <br/>
                positives and negatives. From the macro level to the micro one, this is <br/>
                how DeepAnalyse™ Technology works. Our model specializes in <br/>
                identifying AI generated content like Chat GPT, GPT 3, GPT 4, Bard, <br/>
                LLaMa models … Finally, we employ a comprehensive deep learning <br/>
                methodology, trained on extensive text collections from the internet, <br/>
                educational datasets, and our proprietary synthetic AI datasets <br/>
                produced using various language models.
